# Venezuela Vote Analysis

## Introduction
This analysis focuses on verifying discrepancies spotted in the 2024 Venezuela presidential election results; namely, to analyze whether Nicolas Maduro truly is the elected president according to raw data. The Venezuelan national electoral council (CNE) announced Maduro as the winner with 51.% of the votes, while Edmundo Gonzalez followed with 44.2% of the votes. Not having published the voting records, the opposition denounced an electoral fraud coming from the CNE. On July 30, the Venezuelan opposition obtained more than 80% of the voting records and openly leaked them to the <a href="https://resultadosconvzla.com/">web</a>.
